To run the project either see the "Download APKs" section to download and install either a .apk (Android), or .jar. 
If you want to manually build and run the program, once you have cloned the repo you can run the command "./gradlew desktop:dist" to create a runnable .jar file in desktop/build/libs/

To create an .apk run the command "gradlew android:assembleRelease"  which will put a .apk file in android/build/outputs/apk.

Alternatively you can use Anddoird Studio's built in functions to run the app or export an .apk file.
